## Installing or updating the SqlServer module

To install the **SqlServer** module from the PowerShell Gallery, start a [PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/overview) session as an administrator. You can also start Azure Data Studio as an administrator and run these commands in a PowerShell session in the integrated terminal.

You can also use *Install-Module SQLServer -Scope CurrentUser* to run elevated permissions. This cmdlet is useful for users who aren't administrators in their environment. However, since the scope is limited to the current user, other users on the same machine can't use the module.

### Install the SqlServer module

Run the following command in your PowerShell session to install the SqlServer module for all users:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer
```

### To view the versions of the SqlServer module installed

Execute the following command to see the versions of the SqlServer module that have been installed

```powershell
Get-Module SqlServer -ListAvailable
```

### Install for the current user rather than as an administrator

If you aren't able to run the PowerShell session as an administrator, install for the current user using the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -Scope CurrentUser
```

### To overwrite a previous version of the SqlServer module

You can also use the `Install-Module` command to overwrite a previous version.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -AllowClobber
```
